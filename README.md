## Introduction

The ConveyorBelt-mqtt project aims to provide a robust solution for controlling conveyor belts in various applications. By leveraging the power of Raspberry Pi and ESP32 devices, this system ensures efficient and reliable operations. The camera adds an extra layer of functionality, allowing for monitoring and control.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Use the camera to monitor the conveyor belt's operation.
- **MQTT Communication**: Communicate seamlessly with multiple ESP32 devices.
- **User-friendly API**: Easy integration with your existing applications.
- **Web Interface**: Control and monitor the conveyor belt through a simple web interface.
- **Open-source**: Modify and adapt the project as per your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with ConveyorBelt-mqtt, you will need to set up the hardware and software components. Follow the instructions below to install and configure the system.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model with WiFi support)
- An ESP32 development board
- A camera compatible with Raspberry Pi
- Basic knowledge of Python and MQTT

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/privatebugcorp/ConveyorBelt-mqtt.git
cd ConveyorBelt-mqtt
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install flask paho-mqtt
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Camera

Follow the instructions specific to your camera model to set it up with the Raspberry Pi. Ensure it is properly connected and configured.

### Step 4: Configure MQTT

You will need an MQTT broker. You can use a public broker or set up your own. Update the configuration files in the repository to point to your MQTT broker.

### Step 5: Run the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

This will start the web server, allowing you to access the control interface.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the web interface by navigating to `http://<your-raspberry-pi-ip>:5000` in your web browser. From there, you can control the conveyor belt and monitor its status.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several technologies:

- **API**: For backend communication.
- **C++**: For low-level ESP32 programming.
- **CSS & HTML**: For frontend design.
- **MQTT**: For lightweight messaging.
- **OpenSCAD**: For designing any 3D printed parts needed.
- **Python**: For the backend server.
